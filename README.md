<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We started to learn web development in Sept 22. This project is our first hackathon project using React, Express, SQL and Tailwind.<br/>

We chose to make a interactive website to discover the route of known explorers through puzzles.
<br/>
We made our own database.<br/>

<h2>Available commands</h2>

- `setup` : Initialization of frontend and backend, as well as all toolings
- `migrate` : Run the database migration script
- `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal
- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server
- `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server
- `lint` : Runs validation tools, and refuses unclean code (will be executed on every _commit_)
- `fix` : Fixes linter errors (run it if `lint` growls on your code !)


<h2>Tools</h2>

- _Concurrently_ : Allows for several commands to run concurrently in the same CLI
- _Husky_ : Allows to execute specific commands that trigger on _git_ events
- _Vite_ : Alternative to _Create-React-App_, packaging less tools for a more fluid experience
- _ESLint_ : "Quality of code" tool, ensures chosen rules will be enforced
- _Prettier_ : "Quality of code" tool as well, focuses on the styleguide
- _ Airbnb Standard_ : One of the most known "standards", even though it's not officially linked to ES/JS
- _Nodemon_ : Allows to restart the server everytime a .js file is udated

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>This project was an opportunity to learn and practice React. Some mistakes are expected.
<br/> We do appreciate any feedbacks.</p>
<br/> Thanks ! </p>
